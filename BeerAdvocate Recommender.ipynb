        "The nice feature of the above link is that it is a single-page listing of 250 top-rated beers (avoids the pagination feature, which you need in cases where listings go on for many pages). The way beeradvocate.com organizes reviews is that it provides about 25 reviews per page. The output file should have 3 columns: product_name, product_review, and user_rating. \n",

        "(ii)\tAll scripts \n",

        "This kind of recommender system wouldn't be as elegant or precise of a solution, but it would serve as a simple baseline for an overall average user case, specially when no attributes are given. It's not uncommon when shopping online to do a sort by top reviews or top selling; while these may not exactly tailor to an individual user, they do reflect an aggregate of opinion, which absolutely serves a benefit to the user's decision-making. In addition, with our scraped data we also have attributes ratings available; with these, a recommender could be built to output top suggestions of particular ratings, giving the users a moderately more filtered result. In classic business sense, the answer to the question of whether this kind of watered-down recommender system would meet a user's requirement is: it depends. The system offers a starting point from an overall community's cummulative experience, but it doesn't go further than that like a cosine similarity or sentiment based system would. How deep and individually-tailored does the user need this recommender to be? We can measure this \"need\" by the amount of input preferences that the user enters, and tailor the type of recommender system accordingly. "
